# ml-lime-malaria-prediction
A machine learning project for malaria diagnosis using patient symptoms and multidimensional risk factors, with model explainability via LIME.

This project leverages machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) alongside LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to diagnose malaria based on patient symptoms and risk factors. It aims to provide accurate predictions and transparent model interpretability, especially useful for healthcare professionals in resource-limited settings.

## Objectives
- Diagnose malaria using supervised machine learning algorithms.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- Apply LIME to explain model predictions and enhance transparency.
- Aid clinical decision-making through interpretable AI systems.
